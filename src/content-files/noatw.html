        is a game created by the UTS Playmakers Dev Team in 2022.<br>
        You play as Schnoz Swanson, a friendly little anthropomorphic nose who needs to explore and fill out his collection!<br>

        Climb, bounce, and sneeze your way through two open-ended levels! Explore peaks far above the clouds and a virus infested country town.
        Use the level select in the pause menu to go between levels as you please.<br>

        Use your allergens to your advantage to traverse the world by the propulsion of your own sneezes.<br>
