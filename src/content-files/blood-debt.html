        is a game that I worked on as part of a team for Game Design Studio 1 at UTS. 
        It was selected to be presented at the 
        <a class="link" href="https://showcase.gamesstudio.org/autumn-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 UTS Games Showcase</a>, and won the 
        <a class="link" href="https://www.gamesstudio.org/articles/winners-tech-fest-student-games-showcase-sponsored-msi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSI Creativity Award</a>!
        We were also invited to showcase our game at the SXSW Student Showcase!
        I worked on the procedural level generation, level 3D modelling, UI, and all of the sound design and music for the game.
