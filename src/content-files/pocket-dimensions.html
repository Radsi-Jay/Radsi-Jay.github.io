        Pocket Dimensions is a game that I worked on during my internship at 
        <a class="link" href="https://www.t-da.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T&DA</a>.
        It is a mixed-reality experience where the player can tear open "rifts" in their real world playspace, 
        allowing for the creation of large dynamic environments that the player must physically move around!

        The player must collect and condense energy resources from the dimension that they create, while stabilising rifts that open to prevent the dimension from collapsing.
        The dimension around the player is created from mesh using the marching cubes algorithm.
        I was responsible for a large part of the programming of this project, as well as collaborating on the game design, UI, and VFX.
        The game can be found on the <a class="link" href="https://www.t-da.io/labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T&DA Labs page</a>.
