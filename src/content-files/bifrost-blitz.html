        <a class="link"href="https://radiantinferno.itch.io/bifrost-blitz">Bifrost Blitz</a> is a game that I created for the 
        <a class="link" href="https://itch.io/jam/playmakers-mythology-jam">2021 UTS Playmakers Mythology Jam</a>. 
        I created the entire game myself using Unity over the two days that the jam took place. Bifrost Blitz ended up 
        winning a tied first place in the jam, and marked the first of the game jams at UTS that I would win! The game is 
        available for download at its <a class="link" href="https://radiantinferno.itch.io/bifrost-blitz">Itch.io page</a>.
