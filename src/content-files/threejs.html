        is a JavaScript library that allows you to easily create 3D content for the web. I learnt how to use
        Three.js for my Introduction to Computer Graphics subject. I am quite happy with two of the projects I created for the subject,
        so they are worthy of a place on this page!<br/><br/>
        The first project is a 
        <a class="link" href="https://radiantinferno.github.io/boids/">3D implementation of the Boids algorithm</a>. 
        There is a panel on the top left that lets you change the parameters, but by default
        it makes for a pretty great screensaver!<br/><br/>
        The second project was our final group project, which I had a lot of fun polishing.
        It is a procedurally generated 
        <a class="link" href="https://radiantinferno.github.io/cavegen/"">Cave Exploration</a> 
        "game", which uses the marching cubes algorithm to generate the terrain from simplex noise.
        I learnt a lot about shaders while working on this project, as I had to figure out how to implement
        triplanar normal maps!
