        Fracturegon is one of earlier games that I created and took beyond being just a prototype. I created the game in 2019 using Unity, 
        and working on it gave me a lot of experience with many of Unity&#39;s systems. It is a topdown bullet-hell style game, which I 
        included a number of different enemies, mini-bosses, and one big boss that I was very proud of at the time.
        As far as I can remember, I created all the assets for the game, including the art, music and sound effects.
