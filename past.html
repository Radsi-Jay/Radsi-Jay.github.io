                            <p class="text-area-text">One of the first pieces of "programming software" I was ever introduced to was <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" class="in-text-link">Scratch</a>. 
                                As a young child, its easy drag and drop
                                system allowed me to freely mess around with creating whatever I wanted, without risk of confounding compilation errors.
                                Although simple, it allowed me to start learning the basic ideas of algorithms and programming, starting with simple loops and branching,
                                and eventually moving on to variables and methods. I mostly created obscure little games, or sentence randomisers, with my most recent
                                project being a 2D topdown, randomly generated, semi-sandbox world, which had smooth camera movement, and allowed you to break objects.
                                To anyone who wants to learn the basic ideas of programming in a fun and simple environment, I would definitely recommend Scratch!

                            <p class="text-area-text">Although I continued messing around with Scratch for years, I also started to learn programming with actual
                                code early-ish in my life. One of my first memories of working with code, was when my dad introduced me to 
                                <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html" class="in-text-link">Python's turtle library</a>.
                                This library allows you to control a "turtle", represented by a small triangle, to move forwards, turn left and right, and also draw
                                a path as it moves. This let me create various patterns, such as the one featured in the image of this section!<br/>
                                I also attended a few programming courses in my school holiday, designed to teach children how to make minecraft server plugins and mods,
                                which somewhat introduced me to Java, although I never really understood the complexities of classes and functions until later on.
                                Messing about with making basic html and batch files on the school computers is another activity I remember, I was always facsinated by how
                                I could create these cool things by just changing the extension of a .txt file.

                            <p class="text-area-text">Robotics is exciting, because it gives you the power to bring the funky stuff you can do with computers into the
                                real world! For one of my birthdays, after much pleading, I got a Lego Mindstorms NXT kit, which is a Lego Technic "spinoff", including various sensors,
                                motors and the main controller which you connect everything to. Using the ultrasonic sensor I made proximity controlled turrets, a theramin-like
                                "musical instrument", and a robot that screams if it gets too close to objects. Because of the incredible prototyping power of lego, I was
                                able to do all of this as just a kid! <br/>
                                The most recent experiences I have had with robots, was in year 10 engineering, we were required to make an arduino-controlled robot that was 
                                hard-coded to navigate a maze. I positively despised the fact we were supposed to hard code it, as this meant that the robot was practically useless
                                in any other situation. So I took it home over one weekend, and using another chip, made my robot remote controllable from my phone! It was pretty janky,
                                what with half being held together by rubber bands, but it still worked, and that was, and still is, super cool to me!

                            <p class="text-area-text">In years 9 and 10 at high school, I also chose the Graphics Design subject that was available, where I had my first experience with
                                3D modelling. Using 
                                <a href="https://www.onshape.com/en/" class="in-text-link">OnShape</a>, 
                                we were supposed to model a communications device, but I negotiated, and was allowed to make my own version of a Sonic
                                Screwdriver from the tv show, Doctor Who. I was motivated enough that once I finished modelling it, my teacher 3D printed it for me!<br/>
                                After my interest in 3D modelling was sparked, I moved onto a piece of software called 
                                <a href="https://www.blender.org/" class="in-text-link">Blender</a>. 
                                I followed a tutorial in which I made a ginger bread man,
                                and from there on, I followed heaps of tutorials on youtube, and created all sorts of abstract renders and animations, and of course some memes. Although I'm not
                                using Blender as much as I used to, I often go back to mess around with and learn new skills.

                                with and make all sorts of fun pointless things. I've messed about with coding in various environments, but one that I love, is Minecraft!
                                Either using it's in-game "command blocks" to create new interactions and content, programming mods for the game, or even installing a mod
                                that allows you to add working computers to Minecraft, I have had lots of fun messing about with Minecraft, even learning an entirely
                                new programming language, Lua, for it!<br/>
                                I've also messed about with making various sentence generators, word replacers, text-based adventures and so on. It's always fun
                                to experiment, and quite often I'll learn something new along the way!

                                over these last few years. I programmed a number of games, one of which is even published on the Google Play store (called 
                                <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.NootNewt.Fracturegon&hl=en&gl=US" class="in-text-link">Fracturegon</a> if you're 
                                interested.) As my Software Design major work, I created an app that would randomly generate a weekly list of dinner meals, with features such
                                as saving old weekly lists, generating a list of required ingredients, and importing and exporting all the different meal types to a CSV
                                file that could be edited in Excel! For my Multimedia major work, I created a short platformer game, where I heavily focused on the aesthetics of
                                the world, which I was quite happy with, and my teacher was ecstatic about, which was pretty nice!<br/>
                                That just about brings us up to the present! I'm currently doing a Bachelor of Science in Games Development, and I'm learning and refining my skills
                                in Java, Python, and Bash, as well as the various parts of web front and back end, such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and SQL. I'm excited to continue broadening
