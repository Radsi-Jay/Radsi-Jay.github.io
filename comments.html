                    <p class="text-area-text">I had a fun time designing this website, and learning about the numerous CSS attributes available to create all sorts of
                        interesting features throughout my site. The Past page is my personal favourite, as I feel I was able to create a layout that made my text easily
                        readable, by placing images between the sections of text, which were all relevant to the following paragraph. I think my website is easy to navigate,
                        with the simple sticky navbar, and I am overall quite happy with the final product!
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="text-area-padding"></div>
                <div class="text-area">
                    <p class="text-area-header">Technical Aspects</p><br/>
                    <p class="text-area-text">The webpage is split up into 3 main sections (not HTML section tags, just using the word section): The banner at the top, the navbar, 
                        and then all the content below (the home page also has a footer). The content area is split into a series of sections, which contain text 
                        areas, images, padding and titles. In the case of the Past page, between each content-section there is a div with a set height (500px) that has a fixed
                        background image set to fill the screen, each of which has an id attribute used by selectors in the CSS to set the image that will be used as a background
                        for that area. This, along with the in-page links, are the only two places I really used id attributes. I used class selectors to style the rest of
                        my webpage, as ids are supposed to be used on a single element in a page, and most of the other elements were used at least twice. I could have used
                        ids for some elements such as the navbar, but it wouldn't really of had an effect on the page, so I just went with classes.<br/>
                        I looked into the various cool things you can do with CSS, and implemented a few of the simpler ones in my page. This includes the navbar using
                        the <em>"position: sticky;"</em> property, which lets it stay at the top of the screen as you scroll down, which I used to make the navbar always accessible,
                        so it is easy to navigate between pages. I also made use of the <em>"transition-duration"</em> property to animate the buttons and links throughout my 
                        site, to increase the interactivity of my site, and make it more obvious when you can click on something. One of my favourite examples of this, is on 
                        the index page, I added a small thin grey div under each of the three image links, that appears and grows when it is hovered over, further hinting to the
                        user that the images are interactable links. Finally, I included a <em>"@media"</em> rule, which detects when the aspect ratio of the screen is less than
                        a certain value, which would move the images from being next to the text, to below the text, to ensure that it was still all easily readable.

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="content-section">
                <div class="text-area-padding"></div>
                <div class="text-area">
                    <p class="text-area-header">Aesthetics</p><br/>
                    <p class="text-area-text">I tried my best to chose colours for my page that would not distract the user from the content, so I went with simple monochrome, with
                        a touch of red in the navbar. I ensured all text is easily readable, by colouring it to contrast the background it is placed on, and ensuring that there is no
                        text that overlaps images. I have read that whitespace is an important part of a website, to ensure the viewer can understand what they should focus on, so
                        I tried my best to incorporate whitespace in the correct quantity. Although not technically whitespace, I implemented the background images between sections
                        for a similar reason, as it breaks up the content into easily readable areas, while also displaying images of my past work. As I mentioned in the "Technical
                        Aspects" section, I also used the <em>"transition-duration"</em> property alongside <em>":hover"</em> selectors to engage the user to interact with parts of
                        the website using their mouse. I implemented these small animations, so that when a user hovers their mouse over an interactable item, it would provide 
                        feedback that makes it obvious the item is actually interactable. I've included an example below!

                    </a>
                </td></tr></table>

                <div class="text-area">
                    <p class="text-area-header">Accessibility</p><br/>
                    <p class="text-area-text">According to the W3 website, three of the most common cases of accessibility requirements are providing alternative text for images,
                        support for only keyboard input (no mouse) and transcripts for audio. To meet these standards, I have ensured that all the img tags in my html have accurate
                        <em>alt</em> attributes, that describe the image properly. My website is also entirely navigable with the use of only a keyboard, through use of the arrow
                        keys to scroll, and tab and enter to select links and buttons and navigate to different pages. Finally, using Microsoft Edges inbuilt "Read Aloud" function,
                        I ensured that the content of my website was able to be read by screen readers, which was a success. Given there are no audio aspects of the site that would
                        require transcripts for the site, I would say that my website is accesible to almost all people.
