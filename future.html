                            <p class="text-area-text">I have quite an interest for developing video games, which makes sense given I'm currently studying a <em>Bachelor of Science
                                in Games Development.</em> Making use of this course to further develop my skills in many areas of computing is definitely one of my main priorities
                                for the next three years. I may become an indie developer, or find work with a games development company. Either way, I'd be doing what I love!

                            <p class="text-area-text">A lot of my time with computers through years 10 & 11 involved me using an open-source application, Blender, to create all
                                sorts of 3D models, animations and abstract pieces. Though my skills are far from the best in the world, I'd still consider them to be semi-decent,
                                and I think that it could be part of another possible career path for me.

                            <p class="text-area-text">There are all sorts of different career paths computing can take you down, and if I don't end up with either of the previous
                                two, I could end up in any number of places, from creating webapps to assist with meal planning, to creating sensors to better understand the way
                                plants work. Although I have some ideas of what I would like to do, there's just no knowing till I get there. In the mean time, I'll continue to
                                broaden my skills in as many areas as possible, and I'll see where that takes me!
